<h2>Adapting to Climate Change by Improving Extreme Weather Forecasts with Machine Learning</h2>

<p>A growing body of research indicates that climate change is leading to future warming, with devastating weather events becoming more frequent. Extreme weather events and conditions, such as heatwaves, cold spells, heavy precipitation events, and tropical and extratropical cyclones, take a significant toll on worldwide human lives, public health, economic prosperity, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Therefore, it is crucial to improve our understanding of extreme weather events and predict their impacts through accurate frameworks for forecasting them well in advance.</p>

<p>Observing, monitoring, and predicting extreme events, along with managing their impacts, requires an extraordinary amount of information about the state of Earth and how it changes over time. There are significant differences between various types of extreme weather events. Predicting them necessitates regional and seasonal knowledge about each component of the climate system, including the ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, etc.</p>

Dataset Description:
<p>This dataset consists of a vast number of variables related to: Temperature, Precipitation, Sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration, Multivariate ENSO index (MEI), Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), Relative humidity, sea level pressure, and precipitable water for the entire atmosphere, Geopotential height, zonal wind, and longitudinal wind, North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), Pressure and potential evaporation, Elevation, and KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classifications.</p>
